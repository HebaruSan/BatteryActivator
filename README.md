Overview
Since KSP 1.1, you can't use the on/off switch on a battery unless there is power available. If there is only one battery, or all batteries with charge are off, then an unmanned craft is dead - the batteries can't be activated because there is no power available... because the batteries are off!

This mod automatically pops up a one-button menu if the following conditions are met:
* vessel is unmanned
* there are charged batteries aboard
* no power is available because the batteries are switched off.

The button, when clicked, switches all batteries on, so the vessel is controllable again. This also causes the conditions for the menu to appear to become false, so it disappears.

There are no settings or configuration file.

Installation
The BatteryActivator folder needs to be unzipped and put in your KSP\GameData folder.
